        Machine Learning models are used to predict data of interest using known data as input.
        Recommender Systems are one use-of-case of said models.
        In fact, they are a world of possibilities themselves.
        The goal of this project is to show several possible implementations of a Movie Recommender System,
        including Demographic, Content-based and Collaborative Filtering
        (this one, implemented both with SVD technique and a Neural Network)
        and simulate a production environment were these could be of use, making it as close to reality as possible.
