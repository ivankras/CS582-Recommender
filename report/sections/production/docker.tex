We use Docker\footnote{\href{https://www.docker.com/}{https://www.docker.com/}} for putting our web service in a container,
so to make it platform-independent and don't have to worry about dependencies.
That is, it generates a server itself, exposing the developed API.\\
Our container is available at the DockerHub (\href{https://hub.docker.com/r/barahnofal/cs582-recommender_client}{system} and \href{https://hub.docker.com/r/barahnofal/cs582-recommender_api}{backend})
